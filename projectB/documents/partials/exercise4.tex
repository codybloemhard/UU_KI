\section{Exercise 4}
\subsection{ex4-a}
It is complete because the algorithm will keep searching till it found the path to the goal location or till there are no more
possible paths to stroll, which haven't been visited before.

\subsection{ex4-b}
Yes, because every step pacman can take is equal in cost the algorithm needs to find the path with the least steps.
And because it looks into every path of depth k before looking into paths of depth > k it will
always find the least cost solution.

\subsection{ex4-c}
Yes, it returns a solution, because the algorithm was implemented so well that it does not matter what problem it is used on.
