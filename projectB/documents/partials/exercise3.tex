\section{Exercise 3}
\subsection{ex3-a}
That means that if there exist a path to the goal you are searching for, it will return that goal.

\subsection{ex3-b}
It is complete, assuming that is has a finite depth, because the algorithm will keep searching till it found the path to the goal location or till there are no more
possible paths to stroll, which haven't been visited before. This would happen when the stack is empty
and that can only occur if it has tried every possible path.

\subsection{ex3-c}
It will not always be the least cost solution. This is because it tries out a path and continues it till it ends, which can
lead to the goal location. This first path it finds does not have to be the path with the least cost.
And because it stops after finding a path it doesn't always find the least cost solution.

\subsection{ex3-d}
Yes, the order is as we expected. Pacman does not visit all the explored squares on his way to the goal. This is because 
the first path he explores may or may not be a dead end. If this is the case then he will not go there, because his objective 
is to reach the goal.
