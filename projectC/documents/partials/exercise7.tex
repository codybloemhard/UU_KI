\section{Exercise 7}
\subsection{ex7-a}
No, naive bayes classifier is not a suitable instrument for classifying digits because it assumes the values of the
features are independent of the values of any other features given a class variable. This is not true because digits
aren't made of independent pixels. They are made of lines / curve segements which together for a digit. Therefore it
is possible that values of features are dependent on other features.
