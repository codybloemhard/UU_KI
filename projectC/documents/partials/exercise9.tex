\section{Exercise 9}
Note: Ex8 was made with all the agents having it's own features. However, to check what agent is chosen, i made a simple hack in the code. I works with the command \\ python dataClassifier.py -c perceptron -d pacman -f -g ContestAgent -t 1000 -s 1000 \\ and variants(for different agents). However it does not work with the autograder. I have commented out the real method and placed a all-in-one feature function. It adds features and every agent uses those. It works and gives 4/4 in the autograder. If you want to test it the way i made Ex8, got to enhancedPamanFeatures and follow instructions in the comments.
