\section{Exercise 8}
\subsection{ex8-a}
The perceptron classifier for pacman has a score of 88/100 in on the validation set. Is has a score of 84/100 on the test set. This means it might be a little overfitted, but it can generalize fairly well.
\subsection{ex8-b}
StopAgent: The stopagent just wants to stand still. This is very easy for the perceptron, it will increase the weights for stopping, and lower the weights of all the other things. The perceptron does not need any aditional features, for it can achieve a 100\% score without any features. I gave it the useless feature of the game score.
