\section{Exercise 5}
\subsection{ex5-a}
Sequence weights (a) are more representable of the perceptron because these represent features that are weighted the
most in classifying the given label. Because these features are mostly used to determine whether and input corresponds
to the label it is fair to conclude that perceptron sees weights 'a' as the ones that represent the labels the most.

\subsection{ex5-b}
Perceptron is capable of correctly classifying separable data. In this case digit writings can not be considered
separable data. This is because a lot of digits look very similar. They also depend on handwriting and because of this
a lot of different digits can look alike when written by different people.
